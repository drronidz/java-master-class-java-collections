public class Challenge {
    //
    // When overriding the equals() method in the HeavenlyBody class, we
    // were careful to make sure that it would not return true if a HeavenlyBody
    // was compared to a subclass of itself.
    //
    // We did that to demonstrate that method, but it was actually
    // unnecessary in the HeavenlyBody class.
    //
    // The mini challenge is just a question: why was it unnecessary?
    //
    // Answer:
    //
    // The HeavenlyBody class is declared final, so cannot be subclassed.
    // The Java String class is also final, which is why it can safely
    // use the instanceof method without having to worry about
    // comparisons with a subclass.
    //
    // Hint: If you are stuck, check out Lecture 97.
